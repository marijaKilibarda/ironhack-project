# Mobile User Behaviour - EDA Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of mobile user behavior using data sourced from Kaggle.

## Project Overview 
The primary objective is to uncover key factors influencing user engagement and overall satisfaction. Through detailed visualizations and actionable insights, this analysis seeks to guide data-driven decisions in the conceptualization and design of a mobile app tailored for driving-related experiences.

## Methodology 
1. CLEANING
The dataset appeared clean and well-structured for further analysis. The data entries without relevant funding amounts were excluded from the analysis. 
2. TOOLS
Data processing was conducted using software tools such as (`Python`) for data cleaning and transformation.
3. VISUALISATIONS
Charts were created using (`Pandas`) lib to illustrate trends by demography and OS.

## Conclusion
Leveraging insights from this data can significantly enhance the ideation process for the project. By understanding user engagement patterns, developers can create more efficient applications tailored for high-engagement users, ultimately addressing battery consumption challenges. To gain a comprehensive understanding, it must be delved deeper into various factors, including location and market dynamics, secondary target demographics, and drivers’ behavior patterns. A detailed analysis of these elements will provide valuable clarity and strategic insights, enabling us to optimize our approach effectively.
